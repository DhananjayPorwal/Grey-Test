# Grey-Test

>"Grey-Test" name I choose for this repository because I directly copied or practiced some programs form Internet, So I termed that as Black & on other hand, remaining stuff is genuine and handcrafted by me termed as White.
>When we combine both the colors, resultant seems to be Grey.
>Test word is used here because here I test knowledge of various languages I learned.
>To combine both the concepts we get "Grey-Test" as the perfect name for this repository. 

## The main reason of making this repository public is to share my knowledge infront of audience which helps them to connect dots of their knowledge.
