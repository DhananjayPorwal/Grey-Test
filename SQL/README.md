# SQL

## Getting Started

What is Database?
A database is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed.

### Types of Databases

+ NoSQL Databases
  
Relational Databases: SQL databases which is collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them.

NoSQL Databases: Stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure first - an alternative to the more rigid relational databases.

Q. SQL or SEQUEL?

For SEQUEL:
|Word|Full Form|
|---|---|
|S|Structured|
|E|English|
|QUE|QUEry|
|L|Language|

For SQL:
|Word|Full Form|
|---|---|
|S|Structured|
|Q|Query|
|L|Language|

> Non-English countries preferred SQL as a name. SEQUEL is a trademark of Aeroplane Company so developers of SQL used to call it as SQL instead of SEQUEL.

### MySQL Workbench

We are using MySQL workbench in this course/tutorial. In staring it looks too complicated but it is not. There are three panels i.e. Left, Right, and Bottom.
Left panel has two tabs named as **Administration** and **Schemas**. Administration is used for IMPORTING/EXPORTING data, server management etc... where as Schemas is used for navigating databases which are stored in our machine.
Right panel also has two tabs named as **Context help** and **Snippets**.
Bottom panel shows Action Ouptut and result when we execute any query.

> We can execute single query form a database by selecting that query and executing it using âš¡ button.

## Retrieving data from a single table

### The **SELECT** statement
