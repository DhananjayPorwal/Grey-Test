## Getting Started

What is Database?
A database is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed.

### Types of Databases

+ Relational Databases
+ NoSQL Databases
  
Relational Databases: SQL databases which is collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them.

NoSQL Databases: Stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure first - an alternative to the more rigid relational databases.

> Popular Database Softwares:
>
> 1. MySQL
> 2. SQL Server
> 3. Oracle

Q. SQL or SEQUEL?

For SEQUEL:
|Word|Full Form|
|---|---|
|S|Structured|
|E|English|
|QUE|QUEry|
|L|Language|

For SQL:
|Word|Full Form|
|---|---|
|S|Structured|
|Q|Query|
|L|Language|

> Non-English countries preferred SQL as a name. SEQUEL is a trademark of Aeroplane Company so developers of SQL used to call it as SQL instead of SEQUEL.

### MySQL Workbench

![MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/common/images/products/MySQL_Workbench_Editor_General_Mac.png)

We are using MySQL workbench in this course/tutorial. In staring it looks too complicated but it is not. There are three panels i.e. Left, Right, and Bottom.
Left panel has two tabs named as **Administration** and **Schemas**. Administration is used for IMPORTING/EXPORTING data, server management etc... where as Schemas is used for navigating databases which are stored in our machine.
Right panel also has two tabs named as **Context help** and **Snippets**.
Bottom panel shows Action Ouptut and result when we execute any query.

> We can execute single query form a database by selecting that query and executing it using âš¡ button.

## Retrieving data from a single table

### The **SELECT** statement

```SQL
USE databasename;
SELECT *
FROM tablename
WHERE columnname_id = 1
ORDER BY columnname_name ;
```

Here,<br>
**USE** clause is used for selecting or using database.
**SELECT** clause is used for showing tables.
>     * is used for showing all columns.

**FROM** clause is used showing particular table.
**WHERE** clause is used for filtering result.
**ORDER BY** clause is used for ordering result.

> Every statement is close by **;** 

```SQL
-- Comments are written like this
```

### The **SELECT** clause

```SQL
SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name,
    points,
    points + 10 AS 'new points'
FROM customers;
```

Here,<br>
**AS** clause is used for proposing name for new or modify entity.

```SQL

FROM customers;
```

Here,<br>
**DISTINCT** clause is used for removing duplicate entries.
